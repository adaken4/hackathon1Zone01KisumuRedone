# Peer2Peer Lending on Blockchain and Smart Contracts

## Overview

This project is a Peer2Peer Lending platform built on a blockchain network using smart contracts. The goal is to create a decentralized lending system where users can lend and borrow funds without intermediaries, leveraging the security and transparency of blockchain technology.

## Features

- **Decentralized Lending**: Allows users to lend and borrow funds directly from each other.
- **Smart Contracts**: Automated contracts to manage lending terms, repayments, and enforcement.
- **User Authentication**: Secure sign-in and verification using blockchain identities.
- **Loan Terms Management**: Flexible loan terms including interest rates, durations, and collateral.
- **Payment Tracking**: Real-time tracking of loan repayments and outstanding balances.
- **Reputation System**: User ratings and feedback mechanism to build trust within the platform.
